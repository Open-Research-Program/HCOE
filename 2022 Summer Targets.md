# 2022 Summer Targets

As a community we have selected [10 topic concepts](https://github.com/Open-Research-Program/HCOE/blob/main/Learnings/README.md) to investigate and learn about together.  Working together we can overcome common pain points in making the most of your summer to do research.
****Common Pain Points****
[x] Bandwidth is limited, its a lot investigate myself
[x] 20 minute presentation on the topic will not be enough to learn
[x] Lack of content that resonates with me and that I can actually use
[x] Working in isolation is not motivating
[x] Learning these topics is a nice-to-have and not urgent, so I am not motivated to spend too much free time to deep dive into them all.
[x] Analysis Paralysis; I don't know where to start

## Community Milestones for the Summer of 2022
1. Find 10 Topics Concepts of Interest [x] and Assign Champions to each topic by session [ ]
2. Each Champion selects a subtopic(s) and investigates for practical frameworks they can apply to their research experience
3. Each Champion generates a summary explanation with resources and references to share and discuss with the group.
4. Create a Medium post that is a 3-5 minute read on your practical framework and post to this github repo and encourage others to add to the community effort.

__Milestone No. 4 Note: Posting it on Medium will make it searchable on google for others to find and use. 
An open science principle to make your learnings open to all to find, use, build upon (including repudiation).  __
