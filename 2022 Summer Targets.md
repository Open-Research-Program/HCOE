# 2022 Summer Targets

As a community we have selected [10 topic concepts](https://github.com/Open-Research-Program/HCOE/blob/main/Learnings/README.md) to investigate and learn about together.  Working together we can overcome common pain points in making the most of your summer to do research.
****Common Pain Points****
[x] Bandwidth is limited, its a lot investigate myself
[x] 20 minute presentation on the topic will not be enough to learn
[x] Lack of content that resonates with me and that I can actually use
[x] Working in isolation is not motivating
[x] Learning these topics is a nice-to-have and not urgent, so I am not motivated to spend too much free time to deep dive into them all.
[x] Analysis Paralysis; I don't know where to start

****Community Milestones for the Summer of 2022****
1. Find 10 Topics Concepts of Interest [x] and Assign Champions to each topic by session [ ]
2. Each Champion selects a subtopic(s) and investigates for practical frameworks they can apply to their research experience
3. Each Champion generates a summary explanation with resources and references to share and discuss with the group.
4. Create a Medium post that is a 3-5 minute read on your practical framework and post to this github repo and encourage others to add to the community effort.

# Next Steps
1. Standardize the 1-hour Call format
2. Be a Champion of two Topic Concepts and create a practical framework for subtopic
3. Leverage the Community via the [discussion board](https://github.com/Open-Research-Program/HCOE/discussions)
4. Upload your findings to Github
5. Create a digestable explaination of your findings and publish it on Medium.

### 1. Standardize the 1-hour Call format
Call format moving forward
* Warm Hellos (5 minutes)
* Peer Research Presentation (20 minutes) 
* Logistics (10 minutes) 
* Community Sharing (10 minutes)
* Topic Concept Presentation (15 minutes) 

### 2.  Be a Champion for two topic concepts
****The 5 Step Guide to your 4-week journey on being a Topic Concept Champion****
1. View the [10 topic concepts](https://github.com/Open-Research-Program/HCOE/blob/main/Learnings) and select two topics you are interested in Championing. 
2. Go to the HCOE/[Topic Concept Folder]/README.md and place your name as a Content Champion.  [See more information on README.md](#Additional-Information)
3. Brainstorm subtopics and place them into the respective ReadME.md "Table for Subtopic Ideas" in the "Subtopic" Column, and then select one Subtopc by adding your name in the "Name" Column.
4. Add a brief paragraph summary on the subtopic you are covering and the precise set of questions you plan on answer. Do your best to be precise and clear on what it will be about and what it will not be about. 
5. Collect useful resources and recommendations f

#### Recommendation
Create a reasonable habit for yourself to read about the topic , collect useful sources, and write a key-take away
Pocket 30-60 minutes a day before engaging in your reasearch to discover what the internet has to say about the topic concept.  Then collate  guides and publications you found most useful. Then in your own words summarize the key take-aways in an easy to understand Guide for others to follow and refer to your own experience or other content when making statements.
#### What a being a Topic Concept Champion is not
* it is not being a subject matter expert
* it is not generating new insights 
#### What being a Topic Concept Champion shoud be
* it should be identifying a set of specific questions that you and others would be intersted in answering
* it should be identifying practical recommendations to answering or approaching the set of specific questions  
* it should be an enthusiastic advocate of the topic concept who tries to their best to generate content that will help themselves and others

### 3. Leverage the Community
Ask Questions, announce updates, and poll the community via the [discussion board](https://github.com/Open-Research-Program/HCOE/discussions)

### 4. Upload your findings to Github
Create a Markdown file with the title of your topic that explains your findings. The explaination and format of your findings is up for you to decide.

### 5. Create a post and upload to Medium
Posting content on [Medium](https://medium.com/) will make it searchable on google for others to find and use. 
An open science tenant is to make your learnings open to all to find, use, and build upon (including repudiation).

## Contributing content to a README.md
"README.md" files are markdown filesthat provide a default description when you select on a folder in github.  This description you are reading right now was is on a markdown file! 
Markdown files require a unique approach to performing tasks (e.g. "bolding" or "Creating a Header" or "Creating a table.")   on your written typed content within the file.  The rest is no different than writing on a google document.  See this link learn more about the unique syntax required when typing on a markdown file. https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/
