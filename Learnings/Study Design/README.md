# Basics of Study Designs

This is a basic outline with general descriptors of the various types of study designs you may come across. Underneath each study type is a list of bullet points describing the main takeaways of each to assist you in better understanding what each one entails. A generic example can be found at the end of each type of study design as well. 

**Main Overarching Themes of Clinical Research**
Clinical research is a specific type of research which involves human subjects. 
1.	Observational 
-	There is no intervention in this type of study. The subjects selected for this type of study are observed in a normal setting. The information gathered is then analyzed. The findings of these studies can shed light on possible topics for experimental studies. 
-	Ex. *Do people who drink more than 6 cups of water a day have less acne.*
2.	Experimental aka *clinical trials*
-	There is intervention in this type of study. Intervention is commonly a medication or pharmaceutical agent and is administered in a controlled setting. Various trials of administering this intervention are completed in order to analyze the effectiveness and safety of it.  
-	Prior to clinical trials, there is a long process of lab tests, commonly in animals, in order to receive approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). After approval has been received, Phase I can commence. 
-	There are 4 Phases of a clinical trial. 
- a.	Phase I utilizes a small set of healthy subjects. The main concern during this phase of the clinical trial is the overall safety of the intervention. 
- b.	Phase II utilizes a larger set of subjects with the identified disease/ condition. The main concern of this phase of the clinical trial is the overall effectiveness of the intervention, while still taking the safety into consideration as well. 
- c.	Phase III utilizes an even larger set of diverse subjects. The main concern during this phase of the clinical trial is the effectiveness and the safety of the intervention. How the main intervention interacts with others can also be looked at during this phase. Most importantly, at the end of this phase, the intervention will either be approved or denied by the FDA. 
- d.	Phase IV utilizes the largest most diverse set of subjects. The main concern during this phase of the clinical trial is the potential for side effects. 
-	Ex. *Does medication x lead to improved heart rate in those with A-fib.*

**Descriptive Studies**
There are two main kinds of descriptive studies that differ only in the population they focus on. 
1.	Case Report 
-	Focus is on *one specific patient.*
-	Center of attention tends to be a rare disease or exposure. 
-	Potential to deduce an association among an environmental exposure and its effect. 
2.	Case Series 
-	Focus is on *a group of patients.*
-	Center of attention tends to be a rare disease or exposure. 
-	Potential to deduce an association among an environmental exposure and its effect.

**Analytical Studies**
This kind of study can be used to test a hypothesis, commonly of a causal relationship between variables. These are types of observational studies. 
1.	Case Control 
-	A group of subjects that have already been diagnosed with the condition/ disease of interest and a comparison group that does not have the condition/ disease are first identified. 
-	Medical histories of each subject from both groups are extensively analyzed in the search of a common exposure which could have led to the condition/ disease. 
-	Recall bias from the subjects is something to be cognizant of with this type of study.
-	This study is commonly *retrospective.* But can also be prospective.
-	Ex. *Does smoking lead to higher rates of esophageal cancer?*
2.	Cohort 
-	A group of subjects that have a causative factor or exposure are first identified. 
-	A condition/ disease of interest is then identified. 
-	An inquiry or observation is then done to determine if the subjects with said causative factor in common leads to the occurrence of the condition/ disease. 
-	This study is commonly *prospective.* But can also be retrospective. 
-	Main interest of this type of study is the cause of a disease and/or the risk of developing this disease based on exposures. 
-	Ex. *Does eating salmon lead to lower rates of hypertriglyceridemia?*
3.	Correlational 
-	Various groups of subjects from different populations are identified. 
-	A condition/ disease of interest and a hypothesized exposure are identified. 
-	Whether there is a statistical connection between the exposure and the condition/ disease are then determined. 
-	Ex. *Does living within 1 mile of a highway result in a greater likelihood of children to develop asthma within the first 5 years of life?*
4.	Cross-Sectional 
-	Data is collected at a given point in time across all subjects initially. 
-	Both the exposures and outcomes are measured at the same time in this kind of study. 
-	The emphasis is commonly placed on determining the prevalence of a specific condition/ disease. 
-	Ex. *Does sexual behavior affect the risk of obtaining Monkeypox?*
