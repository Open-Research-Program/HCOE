# Topics Selected to Investigate by the Community
On July 13, 2022, the community was asked to vote on the previously generated [sixteen topics concepts of most interest](#Topics-of-Interest-Raised-by-the-Community). The following table numerically lists topics of most interest to least (1 = highest interest). Note: Topic concepts were bundled to eliminate potential redundancies and form a total list of 10. 

| No.   | Topic                  | 
| ----- | ---------------------- |
| 1.|Getting Published|
| 2.|Scientific Presentation|    
| 3.|Shadowing Experience|
| 4.* |Scientific Writing| 
| 5.* |Working with a Mentor|
| 6.* |Research best practices & avoiding Common Pitfalls to improve skills and understanding of niche. This includes Evaluating and Reviewing research for biases and indentifying meanful insight.|
|7.| Data Analysis|
|8.| Study Design|
|9.| General research & Clinical Research Processes and Pipelines|
|10.|Professionalism in Research & Diversity and Inclusion in Research|

"*" indicates these topics were of equal interest at the 4th position, so they were arbitarily ordered respectively
